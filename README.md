# MoneyModel Web

MoneyModel is a small financial calculator. Give it details on income,
expenses, and desired savings and it can help you plan.

Enter your data. To update a piece of data, simply create a new
one with the same name, it will overwrite the existing. When entering
a saving target with some already saved, enter the start date as when
the current value was current. If you already have some aside, but 
do not wish to save in earnest yet, enter the amount put aside, and 
the date you would like to start saving in earnest.

The "Future Projection" section shows what your financial situation
might look like for the time period that you are trying to save.


## Multiple Data Files

Select a data file or create a new data file.
Data files are where financial models are stored. Please make sure
you copy the "File ID"s somewhere safe, as these will be needed to
recover your model if you clear your browser cookies.

You may recover models not listed by entering their "File ID"
under "Add Existing" and selecting "Add". This is the only way to do
so. If you do not have the "File ID", your model cannot be recovered.

Please note that the 'X' button next to each data file will delete the
file completely and irrevocably without confirmation. Do not click it
unless you really want to get rid of the data file.

To remove all of your data from the system, simply delete all the listed
data files.
